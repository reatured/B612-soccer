# LOOP PLANET SOCCER
## GMTK Game Jam 2025

---

## Game Concept

**Core Idea:** A minimalist 2-player soccer game set on a small **circular planet**, inspired by the theme "Loop." Each player stands upright on opposing sides of the planet and must defend their goal while attempting to kick the ball around the planet's circumference into the opponent's goal.

### Key Features
- **Theme Integration:** The gameplay loop is literal - the ball loops around the circular planet
- **Perspective:** Side view with mechanics operating in polar coordinates  
- **Visual Style:** Minimalist black-and-white pencil sketch aesthetic with blue space ambiance
- **Gameplay:** Chaotic, fast-paced action as the ball orbits the planet

---

## Core Mechanics

1. **Player Movement:** Players move around the surface of the circular planet (perpendicular to surface)
2. **Kick System:** Directional impulse system - players can add momentum to the ball
3. **Ball Physics:** Ball orbits based on circular momentum (fake gravity optional)
4. **Goal System:** Each side has a goal (side-view nets) with boundary lines preventing player entry
5. **Scoring:** Ball scores by entering the opponent's goal area
6. **Ball Behavior:** Bounces, wraps around planet surface
7. **Controls:** Local multiplayer - WASD vs Arrow Keys
